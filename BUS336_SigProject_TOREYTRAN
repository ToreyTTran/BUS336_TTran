>How to import data into python? Numpy? 
# Numpy arrays are the python standard storing numerical data. Efficient/Fast/Clean
# further applications through scikit-learn: Popular machine learning package

# import Numpy package as np
import numpy as np

# assign project data to variable: file
file = 'STARBUCKS.CSV'

# load file as array: BlANK 
BLANK = np.loadtxt(file, delimiter=',')

# Print datatype of BLANK
print(type(digits))

#numpy lacks the 2d labeled data structure needed for deeper analysis, enter pandas
#panads = manipulate, slice, reshape, grouby, join, merge, perform statistics in a missing value friendly manner, deal with times seires etc
#pandas imports files as a database. matrix = rows and columns data frame = observations and variables
